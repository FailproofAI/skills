Everything here is exported from `src/index.ts` (19 lines — that is the entire public
surface):

```ts
export { customPolicies, getCustomHooks, clearCustomHooks } from "./hooks/custom-hooks-registry";
export { allow, deny, instruct } from "./hooks/policy-helpers";
export type { PolicyContext, PolicyResult, CustomHook, PolicyDecision, PolicyFunction } from "./hooks/policy-types";
```

## The policy object

`CustomHook` — `src/hooks/policy-types.ts`, grep `interface CustomHook`:

```ts
export interface CustomHook {
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  match?: {
    events?: HookEventType[];
  };
  fn: (ctx: PolicyContext) => PolicyResult | Promise<PolicyResult>;
}
```

Registered with `customPolicies.add(hook)`. That is the whole registration surface — no
remove, no update, and **no validation of any kind** — `custom-hooks-registry.ts` (grep
`getRegistry`) is a bare array push.

## Context

`PolicyContext` — `policy-types.ts`, grep `interface PolicyContext`:

```ts
export interface PolicyContext {
  eventType: HookEventType;
  payload: Record<string, unknown>;
  toolName?: string;
  toolInput?: Record<string, unknown>;
  session?: SessionMetadata;
  params?: Record<string, unknown>;
  cli?: IntegrationType;   // which agent CLI fired this; mirrors session.cli
}
```

- `ctx.toolInput` holds the tool's arguments — `command` for Bash, `file_path`/`content` for
  Write, `old_string`/`new_string` for Edit, `pattern` for Grep. These keys are already
  canonicalized across all 11 supported CLIs, so you write them once.
- `ctx.session?.cwd` is the working directory.
- `ctx.payload` is the raw hook payload if you need something not surfaced above.

## Decisions

`PolicyResult` — `policy-types.ts`, grep `interface PolicyResult`:

```ts
export interface PolicyResult {
  decision: "allow" | "deny" | "instruct";
  reason?: string;
  message?: string;
}
```

Helpers (`policy-helpers.ts`, the complete file):

```ts
export function allow(reason?: string): PolicyResult { ... }   // reason optional
export function deny(reason: string): PolicyResult { ... }     // reason required
export function instruct(reason: string): PolicyResult { ... } // reason required
```

- **`allow`** — let it through. Also the correct return when your policy does not apply.
- **`deny`** — block it. `reason` is shown to the agent and the user.
- **`instruct`** — let it through but inject guidance into the agent's next turn. Only
  properly supported on Claude Code, Devin and Antigravity; degrades to a stderr note on
  Hermes, Goose, OpenClaw and Pi. Fine for a local skill; do not rely on it if the policy
  will be distributed.

### The `message` field is currently inert — sanitize works by blocking, not replacing

The builtin sanitizers return `deny` plus a `message` that *looks like* a replacement —
`sanitizeJwt` in `builtin-policies.ts`:

```ts
return {
  decision: "deny",
  reason: "JWT token detected in tool output",
  message: "[REDACTED: JWT token removed by failproofai]",
};
```

**But the evaluator never consumes `PolicyResult.message`** (verified 2026-07-24: the deny
response in `policy-evaluator.ts` is built from `reason` alone; the only `.message` read in
that file is `err.message`). What actually happens on a sanitize deny: the tool output is
**blocked entirely** and the model sees the block reason instead. The secret is still
protected — by omission, not redaction — but the model also loses the rest of that output.
Do not promise users "the output is scrubbed and the rest passes through"; it is not.

Two practical consequences:
- Put everything useful into `reason` — it is the only channel that surfaces.
- For output scrubbing, check `sanitize-api-keys`'s **`additionalPatterns` param first**
  (`{regex, label}` entries) — builtin-first applies to sanitizers too. A custom sanitizer
  is only needed when the pattern-per-output-shape doesn't fit that param.

The `deny()` helper cannot set `message` anyway; if you do set it (future-proofing for when
the evaluator honors it), return the raw object literal.

## Events

`HookEventType` — `src/hooks/types.ts`, grep `HOOK_EVENT_TYPES`. The ones worth knowing:

| Event | Fires | Can block? |
|---|---|---|
| `PreToolUse` | Before a tool runs | **Yes** — the main enforcement point |
| `PostToolUse` | After a tool returns | Yes — a deny blocks the whole output (see the `message` note above) |
| `UserPromptSubmit` | On user input | Yes |
| `Stop` | Agent about to finish its turn | Yes — deny forces another turn |
| `SessionStart` / `SessionEnd` | Session boundaries | Observation |
| `SubagentStop` | Subagent returns | Yes on most CLIs |
| `PermissionRequest` / `PermissionDenied` | Permission flow | Yes |

Full list also includes `PostToolUseFailure`, `StopFailure`, `Notification`,
`SubagentStart`, `TaskCreated`, `TaskCompleted`, `PreCompact`, `PostCompact`, `FileChanged`,
`CwdChanged`, `ConfigChange`, `WorktreeCreate`, `WorktreeRemove`, `Elicitation`,
`ElicitationResult`, `UserPromptExpansion`, `PostToolBatch`, `InstructionsLoaded`,
`TeammateIdle`, `Setup`.

## Filtering by tool

`CustomHook.match` publicly declares **only `events`**. Filter on the tool inside `fn`:

```js
fn: async (ctx) => {
  if (ctx.toolName !== "Bash") return allow();
  ...
}
```

An undocumented `match.toolNames` does work at runtime (`handler.ts`, grep `hook.match ??` passes `match`
straight through, and `policy-registry.ts`, grep `getPoliciesForEvent` filters on it), but it is absent from the
public type and could be typed away. Prefer filtering in `fn`.

## Execution model

- Custom policies run at **priority -1**, i.e. after all builtins.
- Each `fn` gets a **10-second timeout**. Timeout or throw → `{decision: "allow"}`.
- Namespaced as `custom/<name>`, `.failproofai-project/<name>` or `.failproofai-user/<name>`.

## Configuration

`.failproofai/policies-config.json` — `HooksConfig`, `policy-types.ts`, grep `interface HooksConfig`:

```ts
export interface HooksConfig {
  enabledPolicies: string[];                              // builtins, by short name
  llm?: LlmConfig;
  policyParams?: Record<string, Record<string, unknown>>; // keyed by short name
  customPoliciesPath?: string;
  customPoliciesEnabled?: boolean;                        // absent = enabled
}
```

Builtins are enabled **purely by presence** of the short name in `enabledPolicies` — there
is no per-policy enabled/disabled object, and omission means off.

Merged across three scopes, in precedence order: project `{cwd}/.failproofai/` → local →
global `~/.failproofai/` (`hooks-config.ts`, grep `readMergedHooksConfig`).
