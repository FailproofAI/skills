  The way to turn what an agent keeps doing wrong into enforcement — failproofai policies that fire on every tool call. Reach for it on vague phrasing: "my agent keeps force-pushing", "it deleted my files again" — a complaint, not a policy request.

  Trigger when the user wants to:
  • act on an audit — turn `failproofai audit` findings into fixes, or ask which policies actually work;
  • stop a recurring behaviour, in plain words or as "write a policy that blocks X";
  • enforce a rules file — make a CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md real instead of advisory;
  • enable an existing builtin — usually the right answer, checked before authoring;
  • work from an AgentEye deployment — findings, plus which hooks fail or over-deny.

  Served by the `failproofai` CLI and the policy files it loads.

  NOT for reading telemetry or operating an AgentEye deployment (that's `agenteye-cli`), designing evaluator scoring logic (`agenteye-evaluator`), fixing the bug an agent introduced, or repo invariants that belong in tests.

# failproofai Policies

A failproofai policy is **a small JavaScript function that runs before or after every tool
call** and returns allow, deny, or instruct. It is enforcement, not advice: it fires whether
or not the model remembers to behave. This skill decides what is worth enforcing, then writes
and proves it.

    what went wrong  →  is a builtin enough?  →  author  →  test both ways  →  plug in

Source pointers here are paths inside the failproofai package — under
`node_modules/failproofai/` in an installed project, at the repo root in a checkout. They are
grep anchors, not line numbers, so they survive refactors. Unusually for this collection the
skill does read the source: failproofai's loader conventions and audit detectors are not
documented anywhere else, and a policy that gets them wrong fails silently.

Five ways you get here. All converge on the same authoring core (*The authoring core*).

**1. Automatically, after an audit.** A `PostToolUse` policy fires when `failproofai audit`
runs and instructs the agent to come here. The findings are already sitting in the cache —
**start at *Triage an audit*** and triage them. This is the primary path: the audit knows what went wrong,
so it should not be on the user to notice and ask.

**2. The user describes a problem.** *"My agent keeps force-pushing."* *"It deleted my files
again."* *"How do I stop it committing to main?"* They are reporting a failure, not
requesting a policy — most users do not know policies exist. Translate the complaint into a
rule, then **go to *The authoring core***. Do not make them specify events or tools; infer from the behavior
and confirm at the end.

**3. The user asks for a policy outright.** *"Write a policy that blocks X."* Straight to *The authoring core*.

**4. Findings live in AgentEye.** The org runs [AgentEye](https://app.befailproof.ai)
and wants its findings enforced — or wants to know which of their policies are actually
working. AgentEye sees the whole fleet, so it answers things a local audit cannot: which
hooks are *failing* (and therefore enforcing nothing), and which are denying so often the
rule is probably mis-scoped. ***Sourcing findings from AgentEye*** has the procedure.

**5. The user has a rules file agents keep ignoring.** *"Agents keep skipping what's in my
CLAUDE.md."* Prose rules are advisory — the agent reads them (maybe) and forgets them under
context pressure. Policies are enforcement. Extract the rules, classify what is enforceable,
and turn that subset into policies — ***Enforcing a rules file*** has the procedure and the classification table.

For 2, 3, 4 and 5, still check the audit cache if one exists — it often shows the behavior is
already happening and gives you real commands to use as test cases (*Verify it fires*).

The single most common mistake is writing a custom policy when a builtin already covers
the case and just needs enabling. Always check coverage before authoring.

## Audit-driven triage

**One finding, or all of them?** If the user names a single finding — by its policy name
(`git-commit-no-verify`), by description ("the one about `--no-verify`"), or by pointing at
a row in the dashboard — do **not** run the full triage. Handle just that one:

1. Look it up in the cache by name, or by matching its `displayTitle` / `examples[]`
   against what they described.
2. Read its `examples[]`. These are **real commands from their machine** — the single most
   valuable thing the audit gives you. They become the should-fire cases in *Verify it fires* (should-deny
   for a block-mode policy, should-instruct for oversight), which means the finished policy
   is proven against what actually happened rather than against invented input.
3. Pick the mode from the finding's severity class (*The authoring core*'s mode table): deny-class findings
   get `deny()`, warn-class get `instruct()` oversight. **State the choice in one line and
   offer the other mode** — "went with oversight since this has legitimate uses; say the
   word for a hard block." The user asked for enforcement; which flavor is their call.
4. Check whether a builtin covers it (*Check the builtins first*). If yes and it is off, that is a config line,
   not a policy.
5. Otherwise author it (*The authoring core*), test against those examples, report back.

Mention what else is unaddressed in one line at the end — do not expand into a full triage
they did not ask for.

Only run the full the full triage below sweep when they ask broadly: "what should I do about my audit",
"harden this repo", "fix these findings".

### Read the findings

There is **no machine-readable output flag**. `RunAuditOptions` declares `--json`, `--since`,
`--cli`, `--project`, `--limit` and more, but `runAuditCli` parses only `--help` — every
other argument is rejected outright (`failproofai audit --json` errors). The one programmatic
path is the dashboard cache, which every audit run writes:

```bash
cat ~/.failproofai/audit-dashboard.json
```

**The cache is the only source, and it can be arbitrarily old.** Check `cachedAt` before
trusting anything in it:

```bash
node -e 'const j=require(process.env.HOME+"/.failproofai/audit-dashboard.json");
const age=(Date.now()-Date.parse(j.cachedAt))/864e5;
console.log(`cached ${j.cachedAt} (${age.toFixed(1)} days ago), ${j.result.results.length} findings`)'
```

More than a day or two old and the findings describe past behavior, not current — say so
rather than presenting it as the live picture.

**Refreshing it is awkward.** `failproofai audit` writes the cache and then starts a
dashboard server on port 8020 and opens a browser, so it never exits on its own. Prefer
asking the user to run it. If you must refresh unattended, the cache is written *before* the
server starts, so a timeout gets you fresh data without leaving a server running:

```bash
timeout 180 failproofai audit >/dev/null 2>&1 || true   # exits 124; cache is written
```

Do that only when the user has asked for fresh findings — it can take minutes on a long
history and it opens a browser tab.

If the file does not exist at all, the user has never run an audit. Ask them to, rather than
running it for them.

**The `AuditResult` is nested under a cache envelope.** The file is
`{schemaVersion, cachedAt, params, result}` — the findings are at **`.result.results[]`**,
not `.results[]`:

```bash
node -e 'const j=require(process.env.HOME+"/.failproofai/audit-dashboard.json");
for (const c of j.result.results.sort((a,b)=>b.hits-a.hits))
  console.log([c.name.replace("failproofai/",""),c.source,c.hits,c.projects,c.enabledInConfig].join(" | "))'
```

Each entry in `.result.results[]` is an `AuditCount`. The fields that matter for triage:

| Field | Use |
|---|---|
| `name` | Builtins are **canonical-prefixed** (`failproofai/block-rm-rf`); detectors are bare. Strip the prefix before matching against config |
| `source` | `"builtin"` = a real policy that *would have* fired; `"audit-detector"` = audit-only pattern |
| `hits`, `projects` | How much this actually happens — prioritize by this |
| `examples[]` | **Real payloads the agent actually produced.** These become your test cases |
| `enabledInConfig` | **Do not trust this** — see below. Always `false` for detectors |

**`enabledInConfig` is a stale snapshot.** It records the merged config as it was *at audit
time*, and the cache persists indefinitely — so a config emptied minutes after a run leaves
every finding still claiming `enabledInConfig: true`. Observed exactly that way in practice.

Always re-read the current config before classifying:

```bash
cat .failproofai/policies-config.json 2>/dev/null          # project scope
cat ~/.failproofai/policies-config.json 2>/dev/null        # global scope
```

`enabledPolicies` is a **union** across project, local and global
(`hooks-config.ts`, grep `enabledSet`) — not precedence. A policy is on if *any* scope lists it.

**Scope matters more than it looks.** The audit spans every project on the machine, but a
project-scope config protects only one. If findings span many projects and enforcement lives
in a single project config, the honest conclusion is that most of those hits are still
unprotected — and the fix belongs in the **global** config, not a project one.

### Sort every finding into one of three buckets

**Bucket A — a builtin covers it and is off.** Do not write code. Add the short name to
`enabledPolicies` in `.failproofai/policies-config.json`. This is the cheapest and most
maintainable fix, and it is the right answer for most `source: "builtin"` findings.

**Bucket B — a builtin covers it and is already on.** No action. Report it so the user knows
the finding is historical, not ongoing.

**Bucket C — nothing genuinely covers it.** Author a custom policy (*The authoring core*).

### Do not trust `DETECTOR_TO_POLICY`

`src/audit/findings.ts`, grep `DETECTOR_TO_POLICY` maps every audit-only detector to some builtin, and its own
header comment explains why: so that "every finding looks like it has a failproofai fix."
Several of those mappings do not actually prevent the behavior. Judge coverage yourself:

| Detector | Maps to | Real coverage |
|---|---|---|
| `redundant-cd-cwd` | `warn-repeated-tool-calls` | **None** — unrelated heuristic. Bucket C |
| `prefer-edit-over-sed-awk` | `warn-repeated-tool-calls` | **None**. Bucket C |
| `prefer-edit-over-read-cat` | `block-read-outside-cwd` | **None** for in-cwd reads. Bucket C |
| `prefer-write-over-heredoc` | `block-env-files` | Only the `.env` subset. Bucket C for the rest |
| `find-from-root` | `block-read-outside-cwd` | Partial — that policy is about file reads, not `find` |
| `sleep-polling-loop` | `warn-background-process` | Partial |
| `git-commit-no-verify` | `warn-git-amend` | **None** — different command |
| `reread-after-edit` | `warn-repeated-tool-calls` | Partial — only if params are identical |

So most audit-only detectors are Bucket C. That is the gap this skill exists to fill.

### Present the triage before acting

Show the user the three buckets with hit counts, then act. For Bucket A, propose the
config diff rather than silently editing — enabling enforcement changes what their agent is
allowed to do. For a single explicit request ("turn on block-rm-rf"), just edit it.

**Never widen scope on your own initiative.** These three are off-limits without the user
asking for them in the current request:

| Action | Why it needs asking |
|---|---|
| `failproofai policies --install` at **user scope** | Wires hooks into *every* project on the machine, not the one they are in |
| Editing `~/.failproofai/policies-config.json` | Global config; a deny there fires everywhere |
| Setting `customPoliciesPath` globally | Silently activates policy files across all projects |

A question — *"what should I do about my findings?"*, *"is this protected?"* — asks for an
answer, not a change. Recommend the machine-wide fix in words and let them decide. Being
right about what should happen is not authorization to make it happen.

Project-scope edits inside the repo the user is working in are fine when they asked for a
fix. The line is **scope**: their repo, yes; their machine, ask first.

## The authoring core

**Arriving from a complaint?** Translate it into a concrete tool call first — a policy can
only match what actually crosses the wire. `references/patterns.md` has a mapping table for
the common complaints (force-push, deletion, secrets, generated files).

If the mapping is not obvious, ask for the command they actually saw, or pull it from the
audit cache — `examples[]` holds real invocations and doubles as your test cases (*Verify it fires*).

Two judgment calls to make before writing, and to state back to the user at the end:

- **Which of the three modes?** failproofai does not only block. Match the builtins:

  | Mode | Helper | Name it | When |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | block | `deny()` | `block-*` | irreversible, no legitimate use |
  | **oversight** | `instruct()` | `warn-*` | risky but sometimes right — *"STOP: … Confirm with the user before executing."* |
  | sanitize | raw deny object (blocks output; `message` inert — references/traps.md §9) | `sanitize-*` | secrets in tool output |

  Default to **oversight** when the action has any legitimate use. Blocking those just gets
  the policy disabled. See `references/patterns.md` for the exact voice the builtins use — copy it.
- **Scope.** Project config protects one repo; user scope (`~/.failproofai/policies/`)
  applies everywhere. "My agent keeps doing X" usually means *everywhere*, not *here*.

### Check the builtins first

Read `references/builtins.md`. All 39 builtins with their categories, default state, events
and parameters. If one matches, enabling it beats writing a new file every time.

Many builtins take `params` (allowlists, thresholds, protected branches) that go in the
`policyParams` map — a parameterized builtin often covers a case that looks custom.

Then check the project's **existing custom policies** — `ls .failproofai/policies/` and
read their `name`/`description` lines. Coverage is not only builtins: a hand-written policy
may already enforce exactly what you were about to author, and a duplicate means two
policies firing on every matching event.

### Choose the event and tool

Read `references/api.md` for `PolicyContext`, the decision helpers, and the full event list.

Rules of thumb:
- Blocking an action before it happens → `PreToolUse`
- Redacting or reacting to output → `PostToolUse`
- Gating the end of a turn → `Stop` (but see `references/traps.md` §6 — unsatisfiable Stop gates — before using this in
  this repo)

### Write the file

Location: `.failproofai/policies/` in the project.

**The filename must end in `policies.js`, `policies.mjs`, or `policies.ts`.** A file named
`block-foo.mjs` is silently skipped and enforces nothing. Name it `block-foo-policies.mjs`.
This is the highest-frequency failure in the whole system — see `references/traps.md` §1.

See `references/patterns.md` for worked examples per event type.

### Verify it actually fires

Loading and execution are both fail-open — a broken policy is indistinguishable from a
working one unless you test it. Never report a policy as done without this step.

Use the bundled runner. Substitute `$SKILL_DIR` with the path to this skill's own folder —
the directory you were told to read this file from:

```bash
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/test-policy.mjs" \
  --policy .failproofai/policies/my-policies.mjs \
  --event PreToolUse --tool Bash \
  --input '{"command":"sudo rm -rf /tmp/x"}' --expect deny
```

Or a batch, which is what you want once there is more than one rule — `{{cwd}}` in an input
expands to the sandbox path:

```json
[{ "name": "blocks sudo", "event": "PreToolUse", "tool": "Bash",
   "input": {"command":"sudo ls"}, "expect": "deny" },
 { "name": "allows plain ls", "event": "PreToolUse", "tool": "Bash",
   "input": {"command":"ls"}, "expect": "allow" }]
```

```bash
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/test-policy.mjs" --policy <file> --cases cases.json
```

With `--policy`, the file is copied into a throwaway directory that acts as both project and
HOME — so `customPoliciesEnabled: false`, the real project config, and user-scope policies
cannot affect the result. It also **renames the file if it violates the loader convention**
(*Write the file*) and says so. Omit `--policy` to test the current directory's real config instead.

Exit code is 1 if any `--expect` fails, so it drops straight into a script.

Underneath it is just the documented stdin protocol, if you need it by hand:

```bash
echo '{"hook_event_name":"PreToolUse","tool_name":"Bash","tool_input":{"command":"sudo rm -rf /tmp/x"},"session_id":"test","transcript_path":"/dev/null","cwd":"'"$PWD"'"}' \
  | npx -y failproofai --hook PreToolUse
```

(Inside a failproofai source checkout, `node scripts/dev-hook.mjs --hook …` is the
dev-only equivalent — `npx -y failproofai` is what every other project uses.)

**Read stdout, not the exit code.** Both outcomes exit 0:

| Outcome | stdout |
|---|---|
| Denied (`PreToolUse`) | `{"hookSpecificOutput":{…,"permissionDecision":"deny","permissionDecisionReason":"…"}}` |
| Denied (`PermissionRequest`) | `{"hookSpecificOutput":{…,"decision":{"behavior":"deny","message":"…"}}}` |
| Instructed | `{"hookSpecificOutput":{…,"additionalContext":"Instruction from failproofai: …"}}` |
| Allowed | *(empty)* |

**Deny is not one shape.** `PreToolUse` uses `permissionDecision`; `PermissionRequest` uses
`decision.behavior`; `instruct` uses `additionalContext`; the non-Claude CLIs use flat
`{decision:"block"}` or `{permission:"deny"}`, and Factory signals deny by exit code 2 with
the reason on stderr. Grepping for a single key will under-report blocks — this exact
mistake produced a false FAIL during testing. `test-policy.mjs` handles all of them.

To test without touching the project's own config, build a throwaway project directory with
its own `.failproofai/policies/` and `policies-config.json`, and point the payload's `cwd`
at it. Project-scope discovery keys off that `cwd`, so the policy loads in isolation.

Test both directions: a payload that **should** be denied, and a near-miss that **should**
be allowed. A policy that denies everything passes the first test.

Two ways this test can lie to you:

- **Empty output proves nothing on its own.** It is the same result whether your policy
  allowed correctly, threw, timed out, or was never loaded. Always pair it with a
  should-deny case that actually produces output.
- **A deny does not prove *your* policy denied.** Every enabled policy sees the event, so
  another one may have fired — a rule matching nothing can hide behind a green suite. Assert
  on text unique to your policy's reason, or test with `enabledPolicies: []`. See
  `references/traps.md` *Sourcing findings from AgentEye*; this happens more often than it sounds.

Use the `examples[]` from the audit finding as your should-deny cases — they are real
commands the agent ran, so they prove the policy catches what actually happened.

### Confirm the policy is actually live

Do **not** rely on `customPoliciesEnabled` in `.failproofai/policies-config.json` — that flag
is a no-op and disables nothing (`references/traps.md` *The authoring core*). The only reliable check is the one you
already did in *Verify it fires*: run the hook and look at stdout.

What genuinely stops a policy from running: the filename convention (*Write the file*), a load-time
throw, or hooks not being installed for the CLI at all. Verify with:

```bash
failproofai policies --list
```

## Enforcing a rules file (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md / system prompts)

Prose rules are advisory: the agent reads them at session start and drops them under
context pressure. Policies fire on every tool call regardless of what the model remembers.
This path converts the enforceable subset of a rules file into policies — and is honest
about the rest.

### Extract

Read the file. Pull out every rule stated as *behavior* — quote each verbatim and note its
section heading. Skip background prose, architecture notes, and anything descriptive.

### Classify

Sort each rule using the classification table in `references/rules-files.md`: hard rules
become a `block-*` deny or a builtin; ordering rules become a PreToolUse gate on the action
they guard; preferences become a `warn-*` nudge; repo invariants belong in the **test suite**,
not a policy; and style or judgment stays prose.

Two classes here are easy to get wrong. Repo invariants ("configs must use the launcher
form") are about file *states*, and policies see tool *calls* — recommend a test, don't
force a policy. And workflow rules enforce best at the **action they gate** (`gh pr create`,
`git commit`), not as Stop gates — tighter feedback, no loop risk (`references/traps.md` §6).

### Check coverage — builtins AND existing custom policies

Rules files are exactly where hand-written policies come from, so the rule you are about to
enforce may already be enforced. Check `references/builtins.md` (with params — *Check the builtins first*), then
read the project's existing custom policies:

```bash
ls .failproofai/policies/ && grep -h "name:\|description:" .failproofai/policies/*policies.mjs
```

A rule already covered goes in the report as covered — writing a duplicate policy means two
policies fire on every matching event forever.

### Present the extraction before enforcing

Show the table — rule → class → action — before writing a batch. Turning a page of prose
into enforcement changes what the user's agents are allowed to do everywhere in the
project; that is a decision they confirm, not a side effect (*Present the triage* discipline).

The table is **not optional and not summarizable into prose**: even when the user
explicitly asked you to enforce the file, your report opens with the table. It is the one
artifact that lets them audit your classification at a glance — prose bullets hide a
misclassified rule; a table row does not.

### Author and verify

Route the uncovered enforceable subset through *The authoring core*. In each generated file, cite provenance
so the policy can be traced back and re-synced when the md changes:

```js
// derived-from: CLAUDE.md § "Workflow rules" — "Never push a branch that is
// missing commits from main" (extracted 2026-07-24)
```

### Report the honest split

End with four lists: **enforced now** (new policies + enabled builtins), **already
covered** (by what), **nudged** (instruct-only), **left as prose** (and why). A rules file
never converts 100%. Claiming it does means something above was misclassified.

## Sourcing findings from AgentEye

AgentEye is the observability half: failproofai enforces inside the loop, AgentEye records
what happened across the whole fleet. Full procedure and verified commands are in
`references/agenteye.md` — read it before running anything. The shape:

### Preflight

`agenteye whoami`. Exit 4 means not logged in, and **you cannot fix that** — login needs a
code emailed to the user. Ask them to run `agenteye login --email <them>` and stop. Note the
permissions it prints; they decide what you may do when closing out. Pass `--json` to every command.

### Ask all three questions

AgentEye answers four different things, and they produce different work:

| Question | Command shape | Produces |
|---|---|---|
| What is enforceable? | `audits findings` → filter `kind == "policy"` | policies to write or builtins to enable |
| What enforcement is **broken**? | `query run` over `hook_completed` where outcome not in (ok, approved) | **hooks failing = enforcing nothing** |
| What is **too strict**? | same, outcome in (denied, blocked) | deny-mode rules that should be oversight |
| What is on the issues board? | `issues list` → branch on `source` | `audit`-born → follow to the finding; `alert` → metric breach, not policy work; `manual` → free text, classify like *Enforcing a rules file* |

`kind: policy` is AgentEye's own classification — `improvement` and `failure` findings are
code and instrumentation work, not yours. The issues board is a **human attention queue**,
not a behaviour log: on a live deployment 0 of 11 issues were policy-actionable, because an
alert fires on a number (latency, error rate, score) while a policy gates a tool call. Read
it, classify it, and report what you skipped — do not manufacture enforcement for a metric.

The middle row is the one no local audit can answer. failproofai fails open (`references/traps.md` *Enforcing a rules file*),
so a policy that throws returns allow and nothing surfaces locally. AgentEye records every
hook outcome, so a failing hook is a query away — and a hook failing hundreds of times is a
live gap that outranks any new policy you might write. Report it first.

### Get the actual commands

`audits finding <id>` needs the **full UUID** from `--show-id`; the short id in the table is
rejected, despite the CLI docs. Its `evidence.queries` are runnable and often carry the exact
regex. For raw payloads: `events --full --session-id <id>` — `--full` is the only way to get
`payload` and it is expensive, so always bound it to one session.

If an evidence query returns nothing, do not assume the finding is wrong — say in your report
that the policy came from the finding's description rather than observed payloads. That is a
real difference in confidence and the user should know which one they got.

### Author as normal

Straight into *The authoring core* — builtins and their params first, then mode, then filename, then test both
directions. AgentEye changes where the work comes from, not how a policy is written.
`agenteye list tools` is worth one call: a policy matching a tool the fleet never emits is
dead on arrival.

### Propose the close-out; do not run it

Print the `issues comment-add` and `audits resolve` commands and let the user run them.
AgentEye's confirms **auto-skip on a non-TTY, which is how you run it**, so a wrong id
resolves someone else's finding on a shared board with no prompt — and triage needs
`audits:write`, which a read-only account lacks. See `references/agenteye.md`.
