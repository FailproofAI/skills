# Builtin policies (39)

**Generated — do not hand-edit.** Regenerate with:

```bash
bun "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/sync-builtins.mjs"   # $SKILL_DIR = this skill's folder
```

This snapshot goes stale whenever a builtin is added, renamed, or has its default
flipped. When it matters, ask the CLI instead — it is always current:

```bash
failproofai policies          # every policy, with enabled status and params
```

## How to use this for triage

Enabling a builtin beats writing a custom policy: nothing to maintain, no naming
trap, no fail-open risk, and it ships with tests.

Before concluding "no builtin covers this", check whether a **parameterized** one
does — several take allowlists or thresholds that widen their scope considerably.
Params go in the `policyParams` map, keyed by short name.

To enable: add the short name to `enabledPolicies` in `.failproofai/policies-config.json`.

## Audit-only detectors

These have no real-time builtin equivalent, so they are the prime candidates for
custom policies. List them from source with:

```bash
bun -e 'const {AUDIT_DETECTORS}=await import("./src/audit/detectors/index.ts");
for (const d of AUDIT_DETECTORS) console.log(d.name, "|", d.category+"/"+d.severity, "|", d.description)'
```

All but `reread-after-edit` are Bash-command patterns, so a `PreToolUse` policy
filtering on `ctx.toolName === "Bash"` and matching `ctx.toolInput.command` covers
most of them. `reread-after-edit` needs cross-call session state, which hooks cannot
see — that one needs a builtin, not a custom policy.
